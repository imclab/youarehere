	<h2>What is this thing?</h2>

	<p><b>you are here</b> is an experimental service to let people record opinions about where a place <em>is</em> and to publish those opinions as a free and open dataset. <b>you are here</b> is sort of like "geo-corrections as a service".</p>

	<a name="really"></a>

	<h2>Really?</h2>

	<p>Consider the following passage:</p>

	<blockquote>

		<p>Never mind so-called disputed places (Kashmir, the West Bank, Cyprus, etc.) all neighbourhoods are "disputed" around the edges. This is often true of localities, as well. For example, the rough consensus in San Francisco is that Delores street is the dividing line between the Mission and Noe Valley. That said there are those people who may live on the one side of the line and very much believe themselves to be living on the "other".</p><p><span style="font-weight:700;">Our experience has been that there are few better ways to pick a fight than to tell someone what neighbourhood they are in (and being wrong).</span></p><p>There is also the problem where the data simply doesn't exist yet or it is just old and dusty, sometimes wrong, and often plain weird : Manhattan Valley, anyone? This is further compounded by the lack of ideas / tools / infrastructure for reflecting changes both socially and politically but, ultimately, those are both somewhat tangential.</p>

    </blockquote>

    	<p><b>you are here</b> is meant to be a tool to reflect those differences. <a title="Long version is long" href="http://www.aaronland.info/weblog/2013/02/03/reality/#youarehere">The long version is over here.</a></p>

	<a name="how"></a>

	<h2>How do I use it?</h2>

	<p>There are two ways to get started using the site.</p>

	<p>The first is to visit <a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}decide/">{$cfg.abs_root_url}decide/</a> and let your browser's location sensors tell the website where you are in precise geographic terms (a latitude and a longitude). The second is to visit <a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}choose/">{$cfg.abs_root_url}choose/</a> and enter a query term that the website will try to geocode. All the geocoded results are plotted on a map which you can pan and zoom to select a precise spot on the planet (a latitude and longitude).</p>

	<p>Now that you've got a latitude and longitude the website will fetch all of the places of a particular type that intersect that point. The current list of place types to choose from are: <b>{$cfg.reverse_geocoder_clusters|@array_keys|@join:", "|escape}</b>. You can jump up and down the hierarchy of place types until you find something sounds right and then associate that spot on the planet with a unique <a href="http://woe.spum.org/">Where on Earth</a> (WOE) identifier for that place.</p>

	<p>For example I've said that <a href="http://youarehere.spum.org/corrections/35525827/">latitude -41.290400 and longitude 174.782245</a> is in Wellington Central, which is uniquely identified by WOE ID <a href="http://woe.spum.org/id/28676779/">28676779</a>.</p>

	<p>Or if you think all of the available choices are wrong you can record that too. Rather than being given a WOE ID the lat, lon pair will be assigned a place ID of <b>-1</b>.</p>

	<p>That's it! Every pairing is assigned its own <a href="http://www.brooklynintegers.com/">unique ID</a> and a permalink and eventually added to the <a href="https://github.com/straup/youarehere-data">public data dumps</a>. You can see all the places you've expressed an opinion about by visiting the <a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}corrections/me/">my corrections</a> page.</p>

	<a name="what"></a>

	<h2>What can I do with this information?</h2>

	<p>That's up to you, really. The primary goal of <b>you are here</b> is to provide a service for <em>collecting</em> and <em>distributing</em> raw data.</p>

	<a name="delete"></a>

	<h2>Can I delete an opinion about a place?</h2>

	<p>Yes. Assuming you created it, of course.</p>

	<a name="privacy"></a>

	<h2>What about privacy and personally indentifiable information?</h2>

	<p>The really short version is that <em>I would be just as happy not store any of it</em>. But I do store some things.</p>

	<p>The only reason to keep anything that might be considered "identifiable" is so that people consuming the data can make better informed decisions about which corrections to trust and so that I can use it track and prevent abuse. Or not. I am still working through the ways in which that might get creepy. Here's what is currently stored in the database:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A latitude and longitude (with a resolution of six decimal points).</li>
		<li>A timestamp.</li>
		<li>Your user ID &#8212; not your Twitter ID but an internal numeric user ID that isn't exposed anywhere on the site. One reason for this is so that the site can show you the stuff you've expressed an opinion about.</li>
		<li>A hashed version of your remote address &#8212; twice-hashed actually. Once using SHA-256 and then again using MD5, just to make the hash shorter.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>The point is not to promote a naked Facebook-esque mirror world but
	to find an acceptable place where privacy interests and transparency can
	exist. That might not be possible and if that's the case then <em>a user's privacy
	will take precedence</em>.</p>

	<p>As of this writing neither the remote address or the user ID are exposed anywhere, including the API or the <a href="https://github.com/straup/youarehere-data">public data dumps</a>.</p> 

	<a name="data-dumps"></a>
	<h2>Wait... did you just say "public data dumps"?</h2>

	<p>Yes.</p>
	
	<p>The whole point of this project is to generate a free and open dataset <em>by and for</em> a community of users that we might use to create new things. <b>you are here</b> is only one piece of the stack but the hope is that it might be a useful building block for new <a href="http://code.flickr.net/2008/10/30/the-shape-of-alpha/">Alpha shapes</a> or <a href="https://github.com/simplegeo/betashapes/blob/master/BLOG_POST.mkd">Beta shapes</a> or <a href="http://mike.teczno.com/notes/gammashapes-for-obama.html">Gamma shapes</a>.</p>

	<p>The point is to be <em>able</em> to make shapes for all the things. Most of the things that <a href="http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2012/08/mapmaker-artist-or-programmer/3132/">Eric Fischer has been making in the last few years</a> are derived from nothing more than an enormous bag of dots (see below) so we are bounded only by our imagination.</p>

	<p>All of the data is released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0 public domain waiver</a> with the hope that it might help get us to a point where we can stop spending all of our time worrying about datasets and start concentrating on <em>actual features</em>. This is what <a href="https://github.com/straup/youarehere-data/blob/master/data/2013/20130330.csv">the data dump for March 30, 2013</a> looks like:</p>

	<pre>
id,woe_id,latitude,longitude,perspective,created
51497773,2479351,40.678523,-74.009335,1,1364688207
51497771,2360582,42.357097,-71.072059,2,1364684731
51497769,23512024,37.784198,-122.417693,1,1364684137
37220706,28751330,40.749441,-73.984831,1,1364682654
</pre>

	<p>If any of the above makes you uncomfortable <em>you should not use this website</em>.</p>

	<a name="https"></a>

	<h2>Why aren't you doing everything over HTTPS?</h2>

	<p>It's true: All the traffic to and from the site is sent over an unencrypted connection. Setting up an SSL certificate for the site has just always been further down the list of things to do than everything else but that might change soon.</p>

	<p>If that makes you uncomfortable <em>you should probably not use this website</em>.</p>

	<a name="api"></a>

	<h2>Is there an API?</h2>

	<p>Yes, however it's not enabled at the moment.</p>

	<p>Barring all the usual bad craziness it will be soon. I sort of expect that most of the traffic to the service will be API-related so there's an impetus to get that stuff up and running quickly.</p>

	<a name="sign-in"></a>

	<h2>Do I have to sign in using Twitter?</h2>

	<p>Yes.</p>

	<p>That's not a feature but this is a project I work on over coffee in the mornings and during weekends so the ability to offload all the user account stuff to a serivce that lots of people already use is very helpful.</p>

	<a name="mobile"></a>

	<h2>Is there a mobile version?</h2>

	<p>Sort of.</p>

	<p>The site has been mostly built on a laptop (see above inre: mornings and coffee). The <a href="{$cfg.abs_root_url}decide/">pages for choosing a place based on a latitude and longitude</a> are not as elegant as I would like but they work. The rest of the site is not so awesome on a tiny screen yet.</p>

	<a name="caveat"></a>

	<h2>What's the catch?</h2>

	<p><b>you are here</b> is a thing that I have wanted for a long time but this is not a full-time gig for me. I have <a href="http://labs.cooperhewitt.org/author/asc/">a Real Job</a> which keeps me pretty busy so all the usual caveats apply. Ideally, it's a thing that can sit quietly in the corner and just chug away unattended. We'll see.</p>

	<p>Also, the site has not been extensively tested in different browsers yet.</p>
